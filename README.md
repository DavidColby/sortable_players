This repo demonstrates using Ruby on Rails and StimulusReflex to create a sortable table. The code in this repo is intended to accompany the tutorial originally published on [my blog](https://www.colby.so/posts/a-sortable-table-with-rails-and-stimulusreflex)

To follow along with the tutorial, work from the main branch. The final, working implementation lives in the sortable branch.

## Project setup

After cloning this repo:

bundle install
rails db:create && db:migrate

After setup, visit http://localhost:3000/players.

The final implementation can also be seen [on Heroku](https://stark-peak-59471.herokuapp.com)
